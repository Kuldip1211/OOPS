# <font> What is a class in Java <font />
<br />
<p>A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.</p>
<p>A class in Java can contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fields</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Constructors</li>
<li>Blocks</li>
<li>Nested class and interface</li>

<h1>3 Ways to Initialize an Object</h1>
<p>There are three ways to initialize an object in Java:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>By reference variable</strong></li>
    <li><strong>By method</strong></li>
    <li><strong>By constructor</strong></li>
</ol>

<h1>Different Ways to Create an Object in Java</h1>
<p>There are many ways to create an object in Java. They are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By <code>new</code> keyword</li>
    <li>By <code>newInstance()</code> method</li>
    <li>By <code>clone()</code> method</li>
    <li>By deserialization</li>
    <li>By factory method</li>
</ul>

<h1>Anonymous Object</h1>
<p>Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only. If you have to use an object only once, an anonymous object is a good approach. For example:</p>
<pre><code>new Calculation(); // anonymous object</code></pre>
