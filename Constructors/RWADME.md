<h1>Constructors in Java</h1>
<p>In Java, a constructor is a block of code similar to a method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in memory. It is a special type of method used to initialize the object. Every time an object is created using the <code>new()</code> keyword, at least one constructor is called. It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such cases, the Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.</p>

<h2>Types of Constructors in Java</h2>
<p>There are two types of constructors in Java:</p>
<ol>
    <li>No-arg Constructor</li>
    <li>Parameterized Constructor</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rules for Creating Java Constructors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Constructor name must be the same as its class name.</li>
    <li>A constructor must have no explicit return type.</li>
    <li>A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, or synchronized.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Java Default Constructor</h2>
<p>A constructor is called a "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax of Default Constructor:</strong></p>
<pre><code>class_name() {}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Purpose of Default Constructor:</strong> The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.</p>

<h2>Java Parameterized Constructor</h2>
<p>A constructor that has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.</p>
<p><strong>Why Use the Parameterized Constructor?</strong> The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values as well.</p>

<h2>Constructor Overloading in Java</h2>
<p>In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without a return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods.</p>
<p><strong>Constructor Overloading:</strong> This technique allows you to have more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler based on the number of parameters in the list and their types.</p>

<h2>Java Constructor vs Java Method</h2>

        <th>Java Constructor</th>
        <th>Java Method</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.</td>
        <td>A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A constructor must not have a return type.</td>
        <td>A method must have a return type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The constructor is invoked implicitly.</td>
        <td>The method is invoked explicitly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class.</td>
        <td>The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The constructor name must be the same as the class name.</td>
        <td>The method name may or may not be the same as the class name.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Java Copy Constructor</h2>
<p>There is no copy constructor in Java. However, we can copy the values from one object to another like a copy constructor in C++. There are many ways to copy the values of one object into another in Java:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By constructor</li>
    <li>By assigning the values of one object into another</li>
    <li>By <code>clone()</code> method of Object class</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p><strong>Does a Constructor Return Any Value?</strong> Yes, it is the current class instance (You cannot use a return type, yet it returns a value).</p>
<p><strong>Can a Constructor Perform Other Tasks Instead of Initialization?</strong> Yes, it can perform operations like object creation, starting a thread, calling a method, etc. You can perform any operation in the constructor as you would in a method.</p>
