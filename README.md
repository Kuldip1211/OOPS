# OOPS
Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
Four main part
# Object
# Class
# Inheritance
# Polymorphism
# Abstraction
# Encapsulation

<br />
<br />

## <font size="7">1. ðŸ“‹ Inheritance </font>

 ðŸš€ When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. 

 
<br />
<br />

## <font size="7">1. ðŸ“‹ Polymorphism </font>

<p>one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
</p> <br />
<p>In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.</p>

## <font size="7">1. ðŸ“‹ Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language </font>

<ul>
 <li>OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.</li>
 <li>OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.</li>
</ul>
